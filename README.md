# Game of Rollups

Overview of all organizational information for the Polymer Incentivized Testnet

## Register

Sign-up form?? 
(we could collect data from participants and explicitly ask for github handles)
(we could send them newsletters)

Add your team information to the `\team-info` directory, following this template:

```json
{
    "team-name" : "team-thomas",
    "primary-contact" : "tmsdkeys",
    "team-members" : [
        "GH-handle",
        "GH-handle",
        "..."
    ],
    "wallet-addresses" : [
        "0x00",
        "0x01",
        "...",
    ],
    "socials" : 
        {
            "platform": "handle",
            "platform": "handle"

        }
}
```

Create a repository for your team (us or them??), following the suggested file structure:

TODO: insert template filetree

## Find a quest

Check out the `\challenges` directory to find an overview and additional information on all quests.

If you decide to take on a quest:
- Create an issue in your team's repo with the label for this quest (it enables us to add you to the overview board)
- Add a label 'help wanted' if you're open to collaborate with other teams (we need to clarify how that impacts grading and rewards)

## Go through onboarding

Follow all or any of the following:

- Kick-off event
    - Workshop(s): use x-ballot-nft example to start from
- Newsletter (IBC 12 steps)
- Developer Hub Docs
- Developer Forum
- Extra resources (ICS repo, IBC info, Polymer blog, ...)

## Build

Build in whatever repo you want, but for collaboration purposes you might want to make code findable (push to repo, use gitsubmodules, reference in your readme)

What if midway another team reaches out? 

## Submit

Push quest code to your repo (up to you how to manage that)

Make sure it complies to submission standards
